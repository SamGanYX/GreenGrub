# GreenGrub

**GreenGrub** helps users make smarter food choices by combining **nutrition tracking** and **environmental impact** in one app.

## üéØ Goals
- **Empower users** to eat healthier and reduce their carbon footprint
- **Simplify decisions** by scanning barcodes for instant product info
- **Combine insights** on both nutrition and emissions in one platform
- **Allow comparison** between food items based on health and sustainability
- **Offer flexibility** to prioritize what matters most (health vs. planet)

## üÜï Novelty
- Most apps focus on either health or climate‚Äî**GreenGrub does both**
- Goes beyond saying "healthy" or "not healthy" to give a more well-rounded analysis
- Uses **ingredient order** to estimate **relative environmental impact**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **React Native** for app development
- **SpringBoot** for backend
- **Nutrition APIs** + custom/third-party emissions database such as **FatSecret**

## Operational Use Cases
- **User Login**: User can log into app via setting a username and password
- **Scanning Barcodes**: Can scan the barcodes of foods and add them to the list of foods that the user wants information of
- **Selective Listing**: Can choose to remove any unwanted/old scanned foods on the list; gives the user the option to update the list however they want
- **Climate Information**: User can obtain climate impact information regarding the foods they scanned and have on their list
- **Navigation**: Can navigate from login page to scanning page to Foods Listed page to Food information fluidly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks
- Emissions data for processed foods is hard to calculate
- **Solution**: Use **relative scoring** based on key ingredients instead of exact carbon values. Over time we can modify the algorithm to be more accurate
